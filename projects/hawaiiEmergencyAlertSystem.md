## Project Goal
This project was designed to minimize Slips and Errors that could occur in an emergency alert system, as used by a normal citizen. This was inspired by a brief moment where the real Hawaii emergency alert system went off, scaring thousands into thinking they were about to die. 
This project was performed with a group of three software engineers, utilizing test-based development. User interaction and experience were of the upmost importance for this project. 

## Skills Used
  The main resources used were:
  * Python
  * SQLite3
  * Sockets
  
## Personal Involvement
I was responsible for collaborating on the redesign, as well as implimenting the UI, text messaging, and login systems.
