The first time I designed anything on a computer was on the first day of a web-building class in seventh grade, taught by a teacher who had little more than my grandmother to do with computer.The class was taught using almost exclusively html, and by the end of the day my website was composed of wonky looking frames, colorful backgrounds, and the coolest flash games I could find at the time. Although my website didn’t look pretty or functional, I had completed the entirety of the requirements for the semester and realized two things that changed my life. 


###First: I had an insatiable desire to continue creating things, specifically using computers. ###Second: I wanted to learn as much about this new found world of human to computer translation. By the end of seventh grade I had already begun learning C++ and was making simplistic games using Allegro.
