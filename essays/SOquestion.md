## Preface

Communication is the basis for human society and somewhere along the lines that trickled down to software engineering as well. While code can be interpreted by looking at it or by careful trial and error most people find themselves at the person oriented end of a book or video. The problem with both of these mediums is that they are finite. Furthermore, Employers don’t want you to program something that’s already been done and professors don’t want you to be working on an assignment which can easily be searched for. 

StackOverflow is where many people end up when they feel they have exhausted their options (for some that point come much quicker than others). A quick glance will show a wide variety of quality in answers and questions. Many people come here searching for others to “fix their code”.  A fair amount of these people receive this, in the form of wordless answers. This forms a reliance, especially on newer programmers. Which leads me to my hypothesis: Better questions, lead to better answers, lead to less reliant programmers. 

## Experiment

For the sake of this experiment I will be examining a few questions on StackOverflow. Their content will be judged based on a set of guidelines created by Eric Raymond, in the article “How to ask questions the smart way.”

The first time I designed anything on a computer was on the first day of a web-building class in seventh grade, taught by a teacher who had little more than my grandmother to do with computer.The class was taught using almost exclusively html, and by the end of the day my website was composed of wonky looking frames, colorful backgrounds, and the coolest flash games I could find at the time. Although my website didn’t look pretty or functional, I had completed the entirety of the requirements for the semester and realized two things that changed my life. 


First: I had an insatiable desire to continue creating things, specifically using computers.

Second: I wanted to learn as much about this new found world of human to computer translation. 

By the end of seventh grade I had already begun learning C++ and was making simplistic games using Allegro.

## Development

As time continued I continued growing my skill set and developing new things. Through highschool i participated in Robotics, developing a couple of robots (including one named after me). My true passion, however, was graphical programming like games. I spent much of highschool developing an RPG engine which slowly became a graphic engine as a senior project. While development on this ended, work on other graphical engines continued to even today. 

## The Future?

SDL, AWT, Java, Lisp, SQL, JPages, OpenGL. All of these are things I didn't know about during that first year of programming, but now I holde each of them close to my heart. Everyday i find myself developing more and more, and learning more interesting facts. I don't know where the future will take me, but i hope with all of my heart that I keep learning new things every day.
