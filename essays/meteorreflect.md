## First Impressions

I think I made it perfectly clear when i began working with meteor that I thought it was complete garbage. I recognized it to be perfectly managable, but in a world where hundreds of frameworks exist it's hard to sell something on being only managable. My initial reactions were formed by a lack of understanding of certain facets of the framework. To some extent I still have these issues, but have found the underlying cause to be a flexibility that is both endearing and useful to spagetti code my way through certain issues. 

When I first began learning Meteor I didn't quite understand it. There isn't a great teaching tool for meteor and that is because it is so interweaven. I now understand it and am still occasionally met with war like flashbacks of my first few hours with the system. While not being a strict requirement of any good framework, being able to have a simple structure to teach people piece by piece is handy. It's 2017, and colleges teach students java and python first for a reason. Machine code can be amazingly optimized, but why should someone learn memory managment before being able to write hello world. 

## Current Impressions / The Change

I'm not sure where the realization of how to use meteor hit, and I'm not entirely sure it did hit all at once. There was a point where I was copying code and then a point where i was writing out applications like without a single reference and strangely there was no inbetween. Perhaps this is a compliment to meteor or perhaps a compliment to the learning system used. Either way I now feel confident enough to state my current, and probably to the death, thoughts on meteor. 
## Why is it important?

Configuration Managment is important for almost the exact reason people often believe they are not. Configuration Managment allows people to tell what is changed, what files exist, how they are organized, and how they can be modified. A beginner intrinsically believes that they can take care of this. If my experience holds any merit, even small teams believe that they can mangage things without these notes but it quickly becomes overwhelming.

The human brain isn't particularly adept at figuring out the smallest changes. Anyone who has spent time looking for a semicolon can tell you that there are obvious glaring flaws with the way we scan things. This compounds with the fact that users aren't necessarilly able to identify changes other people have made and the writing is on the wall.

Configuration Managment is a necessity. 

## How good is our solution?

For the average user i would consider GitHub the go to for Configuration Management. Its uniformity allows a format that most people will have to pick up in their lives. GitHub is based around Git, which I personally thought was a lightweight version of GitHub before learning the truth. Its simple enough. It allows users to make changes on nearly any machine, on or offline. These changes can be uploaded, noted, and changes are shown.

That being said the current methods for configuration manegment just barely work (not in the same way that apple products "Just Work"). They seem like an artifact from older days, their functions seem primitive and unintuitive. From a "Human Computer Interactions" standpoint they dont relate to anything physically and the UI's people have built to manage them often seem lacking. GitHubs own desktop client requires the user to use the website to fork a project, even if it is their own. A major reform seems necessary. 

Furthermore, from the outside Git isn't very friendly seeming. I put off my own learning of it for a long time because I was afraid to fail at it. This all goes without even mentioning the troubles that can be caused by trying to merge a branch. 

But all of those problems seem to be with humans. 

Should the machine work by itself it would be perfect, but sadly that isn't a solution. Bad comments, iffy commits, weird branching is all caused by people not knowing how to behave correctly.
