## Preface

Anyone who has sat down to develop a website from scratch (pure HTML or CSS) has probably had a bit of success. Maybe not much, just a tiny nugget of success. Perhaps, rather, they had a huge mound of success by creating a massive website with divs flying around, a perfect color scheme, and a mountain of style sheets three miles wide. At the end of the day there was a website but is that enough?

The person who created the beautiful website probably sat around thinking about how much time they spent working on the project, and most likely found that a lot of their css sheets are specific to the page they made. The person who only made a barely functional page was probably kicking themselves thinking of how they could have made the page prettier. Sadly the solution was just a google search away. Frameworks. But are they a good solution?

### Breif

After having spent a fair ammount of time working with Semantic UI I wanted to ask myself, was it worth it. For the purposes of this write-up I will be using Semantic UI for any examples given. 

Several peices of my semantic UI work can be found on my github [here.](http://github.com/joryleech) These are available for forking. For a live version of Semantic UI that I created for a personal project see  [Hackmeleon.ga](http://hackmeleon.ga).
  
### The Pros of Frameworks.

Imagine a world where you can show someone your code and the person who looks at it isn't immediatly brought aback by one or more of your coding preferences. Whether you use tabs or spaces or never add a new line unless you use a different function, imagine no one cared.

For a personal project this could almost work, most novices code this way before they know someone else who programs and begin to have this debate. Imagine that style of formatting being randomly distrubuted to every single person you have ever looked at the code of and one last time lets assume that you don't judge them. The time alone it would take to read and try to comprehend the code that was put in front you would double, maybe tripple. The ammount of time this could steal in a company could cost millions. Productivity drops, there are less products to push, and honestly the bulk of the workload moves from trying to work on the problem to trying to understand what was already done to work on the issue. 


### Example 2 : Perfect People (Robots)
  
Now I would like you too imagine a world where everyone has the same coding standards, no matter what they are everyones code for a single problem would look identicle. Of course there isn't a good solution to all problems using the same coding standards but lets pretend. Imagine the ammount of productivity that could be accomplished if everyone intrinsically could at least understand the formaatting of a code before reading it. 

Of course people could never actually accomplish this because people are difficult and there is no black and white way to say which format is better. However, given the format of a problem and a limited set of people like what can be found in a company this goal becomes very easy to accomplish. 

## Conclusion

Why does this all matter you might ask yourself? The life of a programmer is to make tools that make life easier, so why not use a little of your own knowledge to make your own and others life easier. At the moment there are only a few ways that these Coding Standards can be implemented and they don't tend to be user friendly. It has been an uphill battle trying to implement nicely organized code, stemming from the mess of packed code in the seventies. But for our sake and the sake of everyone else, it will make our lives better.
