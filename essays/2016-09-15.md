## The Evolution

The first group project I ever worked on was between me and a few of my friends. The code was mostly done in a similar space and was traded around using emails and jump drives. The project inevitably died but before it did it had its fair share of troubles.

	At the time the group of us had only passingly heard of github. It was that website that everyone put their open source projects on. Not us, of course, but everyone else. The people we liked to watch and see what they coded. At the time we had very little understanding of it. Looking back on it now, a Source Code Control System would have made our lives infinitely easier. 
	
	It's fair to say at the time GitHub was a household name for people of our kind, and it has grown steadily since. It almost seems unfair to the people who originally created GIT, the backend to the entire system. I originally thought that GIT was just a small pocket sized version of GITHUB. Obviously, I found out quickly I was wrong but that perspective shows how GitHubs unanimosity has grown.
